27,Millionaire MBA: FREE Sample,"You've just stumbled upon Millionaire MBA... it's likely you're now asking, 'What is Millionaire MBA (Mentoring By Audio) and What's in it for me?'.

You may even be asking, 'Will Millionaire MBA make me successful as an entrepreneur?', to which the answer is 'yes, no, maybe'.

Here's the story...

A few summers ago, 25 UK based self-made millionaires, entrepreneurs and business leaders were interviewed at their homes, offices and hotels. 

These entrepreneurs included Duncan Bannatyne and Simon Woodroffe from Dragons' Den, Sir Tom Hunter, Lord Harris, Lord Billimoria and 20 other high-profile and ultra-successful business leaders, plus 4 other experts in motivation, sales and marketing (these experts are self-made millionaires too!).

They each took an hour or two out of their busy schedules to answer a series of 25 identical questions. 

Each question probed deeply into what made them successful, with the goal to uncover exactly why these entrepreneurs were able to achieve the extraordinary business results they had.

The type of questions each entrepreneur was asked were: 

: What is the millionaire mindset?
: What is the difference between you and others who haven't achieved your level of success?
: How did you know you'd be successful as an entrepreneur?
: Tell us about your appetite for risk?
: What are the fundamentals of business?
: How do you make a million?
: And many more searching questions.

Each answer was recorded using high quality digital recording equipment, and their responses were chopped up, edited, and using the principles of NLP (Neuro Linguistic programming), analysed to find a consistent thinking pattern which is common amongst self-made millionaire entrepreneurs.

The output of that work is Millionaire MBA Business Mentoring Programme - an audio-based mentoring programme which teaches you to think like a self-made millionaire entrepreneur.

So, can Millionaire MBA help you become successful as an entrepreneur? Again, the answer is 'yes, no, maybe', it's very much up to you.

The tools are here for you to learn how successful self-made millionaire entrepreneurs think, act and make decisions - and the programme has been designed to help you think this way too. How you use the information, advice and guidance in Millionaire MBA, is up to you!

NB: This is not an MBA, but it will teach you some of the things which are not taught on traditional MBA courses which real-life entrepreneurs know!","You&#39;ve just stumbled upon Millionaire MBA... it&#39;s likely you&#39;re now asking, &#39;What is Millionaire MBA (Mentoring By Audio) and What&#39;s in it for me?&#39;.<br><br>You may even be asking, &#39;Will Millionaire MBA make me successful as an entrepreneur?&#39;, to which the answer is &#39;yes, no, maybe&#39;.<br><br>Here&#39;s the story...<br><br>A few summers ago, 25 UK based self-made millionaires, entrepreneurs and business leaders were interviewed at their homes, offices and hotels. <br><br>These entrepreneurs included Duncan Bannatyne and Simon Woodroffe from Dragons&#39; Den, Sir Tom Hunter, Lord Harris, Lord Billimoria and 20 other high-profile and ultra-successful business leaders, plus 4 other experts in motivation, sales and marketing (these experts are self-made millionaires too!).<br><br>They each took an hour or two out of their busy schedules to answer a series of 25 identical questions. <br><br>Each question probed deeply into what made them successful, with the goal to uncover exactly why these entrepreneurs were able to achieve the extraordinary business results they had.<br><br>The type of questions each entrepreneur was asked were: <br><br>: What is the millionaire mindset?<br>: What is the difference between you and others who haven&#39;t achieved your level of success?<br>: How did you know you&#39;d be successful as an entrepreneur?<br>: Tell us about your appetite for risk?<br>: What are the fundamentals of business?<br>: How do you make a million?<br>: And many more searching questions.<br><br>Each answer was recorded using high quality digital recording equipment, and their responses were chopped up, edited, and using the principles of NLP (Neuro Linguistic programming), analysed to find a consistent thinking pattern which is common amongst self-made millionaire entrepreneurs.<br><br>The output of that work is Millionaire MBA Business Mentoring Programme - an audio-based mentoring programme which teaches you to think like a self-made millionaire entrepreneur.<br><br>So, can Millionaire MBA help you become successful as an entrepreneur?

Mini-MBA is a term used by many non-profit and for-profit institutions to describe a training regimen focused on the fundamentals of business. In the past, Mini-MBA programs have typically been offered as non-credit bearing courses that require less than 100 hours of total learning. However, due to the criticisms of these certificates, many schools have now shifted their programs to offer courses for full credit so that may be applied towards a complete traditional MBA degree. This is to allow students to verify business related coursework for employment purposes and still allow the option complete a full-time MBA degree program at a later period if they elect to do so.


The Master of Business Administration (MBA or M.B.A.) is a master's degree in business administration (management). The MBA degree originated in the United States in the late 19th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific approaches to management. The core courses in an MBA Master in business administration program cover various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. Most programs also include elective courses.

The MBA is a terminal degree and a professional degree. Accreditation bodies specifically for MBA programs ensure consistency and quality of education. Business schools in many countries offer programs tailored to full-time, part-time, executive, and distance learning students, many with specialized concentrations.","This is the only  Professional comprehensive Mini MBA android application that covers covers 22 business management topics &amp; contains about 2500 Study notes, concepts and exam questions.

81,Icarus (Global MBA),"This business simulation will provide students working in small teams with a complex business challenge set in a real-life context, where research into the market and the industry will be directly relevant to and consistent with the simulated business. 

Students will be able to use the model to explore different strategies, and carry out what-if analysis and scenario planning to test the robustness of their plans. 

The simulation will be designed to include the following stages:
1. Research and analysis. Students will have access to past financial results of the simulation company and will be expected to research the real economic and competitive environment of the industry. 
2. Teamworking. The simulation will include built-in social media tools to enable students in different locations to communicate and work as teams in managing their airports. A nominated Chief Executive will be responsible for co-ordinating plans and submitting the agreed decisions each period. Teams will be able to rotate the CEO and other roles. 
3. Planning. Using the simulation, the students will be able to build a five-year business plan, including exploring and comparing different strategies and testing the robustness of their plans in different external scenarios. 
4. Implementation. Team decisions will be processed through the “real world” model and teams will be able to compare their actual results against their plans and budgets and also benchmark their progress against other student teams. They also receive feedback about the market and data about changes in the competitive environment.
5. Reflection and further decision making. The student can adapt their plans, review their decisions and respond to new stimulae before submitting the second set of decisions. 
6. Final report. Students may provide individual and/or team reports for tutors to provide feedback on.","This business simulation will provide students working in small teams with a complex business challenge set in a real-life context, where research into the market and the industry will be directly relevant to and consistent with the simulated business. <br><br>Students will be able to use the model to explore different strategies, and carry out what-if analysis and scenario planning to test the robustness of their plans. <br><br>The simulation will be designed to include the following stages:<br>1.

Before 2009, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates. The pattern, number of questions and duration have seen considerable variations over the years.

On 1 May 2009, it was announced that CAT would be a Computer Based Test starting from 2009. The American firm Prometric was entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the test from 2009 to 2013.[6] The first computer based CAT was marred with technical snags.[7] The issue was so serious that it prompted the Government of India to seek a report from the convenor.[8] The trouble was diagnosed as 'Conficker' and 'W32 Nimda', the two viruses that attacked the system display of the test, causing server slow down.[9] Since 2014 onward, CAT has been conducted by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). CAT 2015 and CAT 2016 were 180-minute tests consisting of 100 questions (34 from Quantitative Ability (QA), 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR))
CAT Exam Pattern is unpredictable and it changes every year. Since last two years, the structure of the test has undergone a few changes. As per the notification released by IIM Lucknow, there is no such change introduced in CAT 2017 Exam Pattern. CAT is a computer-based test which consists of 100 objective type questions. There are 3 sections in the test:

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC)
Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)
Quantitative Ability (QA)
The Quantitative Ability and Verbal & Reading Comprehension sections consisted 34 questions each, whereas the Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning section had 32 questions. This distribution of questions was same for CAT 2015 and CAT 2016. Before this, the distribution of questions was different. In CAT 2017, it is expected that a number of questions in each section may vary as compared to the previous year.

For CAT 2017, IIM Lucknow has released some points related to CAT Exam Pattern such as-

A few questions in each section of CAT may be of non-MCQs type questions (TITA- Type In The Answer).
Exactly 60 minutes will be allotted for answering each section.
Each question carries 3 marks and there is negative marking of 1 mark for each wrong answer.
No negative marking for non-MCQ type questions.
A virtual calculator (on-screen calculator) will be available throughout for the purpose of calculation.
The test takers cannot switch between the sections and have to attend the test in a particular order. The order of the sections is same for all the applicants-

VARC
DI & LR, and
QA
Four scaled scores will be presented for each candidate: an overall scaled score and three separate scaled scores for each section. As the three sections evaluate distinct sets of knowledge and skills, scores do not correlate across sections. A high score in one section does not guarantee a high score in another section. Percentile rankings are provided for each individual section as well as for the overall exam score.","CAT MBA Entrance Exam Quiz <br><br>Key Features of this APP: <br>•	At practice mode you can see the explanation describing the correct answer.<br>•	Real exam style full mock exam with timed interface<br>•	Ability to create own quick mock by choosing the number of MCQ’s.<br>•	You can create your profile and see your result history with just one click.<br>•	This app contains large number of question set that covers all syllabus area.<br><br>Before 2009, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates.

135,Shooting Hoops - 3 Point Basketball Games,"""Fans of basketball games and basketball fanatics, it’s time to show off your basketball shooting skills! How would you like to be a basketball star? Put your skills to the test: make as many three point shots as you can with 60 seconds on the clock, take part in our awesome three point contest and dominate the court!
HOW TO PLAY:
1. Touch the screen to pick up the basketball
2. Hold until the bar is full
3. Release to shoot a 3 pointer - if you lift your finger too early or too late, you’ll miss the shot!

FEATURES:
Realistic 3D graphics
Player customization options: 
- choose the name for your player and team
- choose your jersey, sneakers, hairstyle and much more!
* GET cool bonuses for creating a set - jersey, sneakers and a basketball!
25+ cities – variety of environments to play in
3 missions in each city
Daily missions for extra experience points and rewards
30+ unlockable basketballs
Enter the competition and practice until you become a star of shooting hoops!

Shoot basketball from the three-point line and get the balls in the hoop in the shortest amount of time! You’ve got a minute to complete three missions in order to move to the next city. Start in New York and travel around the world as you’re shooting hoops in 9 regions of the world!

Brace yourself, your basketball shooting skills will be put to a proper test!

As you move around the globe and change cities and basketball courts, your three point shooting skills must improve rapidly to successfully complete missions. Missions become more challenging as you progress through this basketball game: you’ll need to score more points with more time left on the shot clock, or finish your three point shooting series without making air ball or brick balls. Feel the thrill of scoring a buzzer beater and do not let your nerves get to you!

Before 2009, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates. The pattern, number of questions and duration have seen considerable variations over the years.

On 1 May 2009, it was announced that CAT would be a Computer Based Test starting from 2009. The American firm Prometric was entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the test from 2009 to 2013.[6] The first computer based CAT was marred with technical snags.[7] The issue was so serious that it prompted the Government of India to seek a report from the convenor.[8] The trouble was diagnosed as 'Conficker' and 'W32 Nimda', the two viruses that attacked the system display of the test, causing server slow down.[9] Since 2014 onward, CAT has been conducted by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). CAT 2015 and CAT 2016 were 180-minute tests consisting of 100 questions (34 from Quantitative Ability (QA), 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR))
CAT Exam Pattern is unpredictable and it changes every year. Since last two years, the structure of the test has undergone a few changes. As per the notification released by IIM Lucknow, there is no such change introduced in CAT 2017 Exam Pattern. CAT is a computer-based test which consists of 100 objective type questions. There are 3 sections in the test:

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC)
Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)
Quantitative Ability (QA)
The Quantitative Ability and Verbal & Reading Comprehension sections consisted 34 questions each, whereas the Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning section had 32 questions. This distribution of questions was same for CAT 2015 and CAT 2016. Before this, the distribution of questions was different. In CAT 2017, it is expected that a number of questions in each section may vary as compared to the previous year.

For CAT 2017, IIM Lucknow has released some points related to CAT Exam Pattern such as-

A few questions in each section of CAT may be of non-MCQs type questions (TITA- Type In The Answer).
Exactly 60 minutes will be allotted for answering each section.
Each question carries 3 marks and there is negative marking of 1 mark for each wrong answer.
No negative marking for non-MCQ type questions.
A virtual calculator (on-screen calculator) will be available throughout for the purpose of calculation.
The test takers cannot switch between the sections and have to attend the test in a particular order. The order of the sections is same for all the applicants-

VARC
DI & LR, and
QA
Four scaled scores will be presented for each candidate: an overall scaled score and three separate scaled scores for each section. As the three sections evaluate distinct sets of knowledge and skills, scores do not correlate across sections. A high score in one section does not guarantee a high score in another section. Percentile rankings are provided for each individual section as well as for the overall exam score.","CAT MBA Entrance Test Prep<br><br>Key Features of this APP: <br>•	At practice mode you can see the explanation describing the correct answer.<br>•	Real exam style full mock exam with timed interface<br>•	Ability to create own quick mock by choosing the number of MCQ’s.<br>•	You can create your profile and see your result history with just one click.<br>•	This app contains large number of question set that covers all syllabus area.<br><br>Before 2009, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates.

* Graphically displays MBA profiles as a function of Social Security filing age.
* Displays MBA profiles for single individuals or joint filers.

- The Banking and Finance Academy – to conduct training and capacity development programs on banking and finance;
- The Credit Guarantee Fund – to provide credit guarantee service;

Since its establishment in 2000, MBA has managed to expand itself to a professional industry association through its membership.

211,IQ and Aptitude Test Practice,"Call it an Intelligence test, IQ test, aptitude test, or psychometric test, they are used in schools, admission exams, and job interviews to assess the ability of applicants in processing information. This free IQ test application provides more than 100 IQ test questions with answers. The aptitude test questions are nonverbal and are categorized into logical, spatial, and numerical tests. 
If you plan to take SHL or Kenexa logical or inductive Reasoning Test as part of a job interview then these tests can be useful, also for other similar tests like a general IQ test, MENSA test, Logical test, Intelligence test, or DAT test. 

Besides preparing for a job application assessment, solving these short puzzles is a mental exercise, potentially improving the inductive and logical reasoning, numerical and spatial abilities of the users. 

Hints and solutions are provided for most of the questions. Based on your performance you will receive an IQ (Intelligence Quota) score. The IQ score is calculated based on the deviation of your score to the average score by other users. Every standard deviation is counted as 15 units of IQ score.

Taking the IQ test and scoring is offline and the score is given free of charge(does not require internet connection).

You must consider that the sample population that is used to calculate the IQ score in this application is probably smarter than the average population of the world. Hence the IQ score calculated by this app would be lower than the IQ score that is calculated based on the whole population of the world. 

The focus of this application is on three types of tests:
1- Logical reasoning tests (or inductive reasoning tests): Logical tests appear in several categories and variations, namely: analogies, progressive series, Raven's matrix test, and classification tests.

2- Numerical tests: In the form of number series, number analogies and number matrices. These are encountered in IQ tests, and job interview tests for quantitative roles (e.g. trading, finance, banking, and software developing).

3- Spatial reasoning: In the form of two-dimensional pattern matching, and paper folding. 

4- Memory test: Test  your short-term memory and compare it with the average population

5- Unlimited practice with cube test (three-dimensional spatial ability) 

6- Unlimited practice with mental arithmetic test
 
The following non-verbal tests are available now:

Nonverbal Logical reasoning test:
- Visual analogy (a.k.a shape analogy)
- Progressive series (A sequence of shapes)
-Classification (Choose the odd one!)
- Matrix tests    (A grid of shapes)

Numerical reasoning:
 -Numerical analogies (Find a logical relation between two sets of numbers)
- Number series (Find the next number in a sequence of numbers!)
- Number matrices   (Find the missing number in a grid of numbers)
- Mental arithmetic

Spatial reasoning test:
- Two-dimensional spatial ability (Pattern matching and assembling)
- Three-dimensional spatial ability (Folding 2-dimensional shapes into 3-dimensional objects- Cube test)

Short-term memory test:
-Memorize and recall a sequence of numbers, letters, colors, and pictures. Comparison to average population is offered.

mental arithmetic test:

Before 2009, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates. The pattern, number of questions and duration have seen considerable variations over the years.

On 1 May 2009, it was announced that CAT would be a Computer Based Test starting from 2009. The American firm Prometric was entrusted with the responsibility of conducting the test from 2009 to 2013.[6] The first computer based CAT was marred with technical snags.[7] The issue was so serious that it prompted the Government of India to seek a report from the convenor.[8] The trouble was diagnosed as 'Conficker' and 'W32 Nimda', the two viruses that attacked the system display of the test, causing server slow down.[9] Since 2014 onward, CAT has been conducted by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). CAT 2015 and CAT 2016 were 180-minute tests consisting of 100 questions (34 from Quantitative Ability (QA), 34 from Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), and 32 from Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR))
CAT Exam Pattern is unpredictable and it changes every year. Since last two years, the structure of the test has undergone a few changes. As per the notification released by IIM Lucknow, there is no such change introduced in CAT 2017 Exam Pattern. CAT is a computer-based test which consists of 100 objective type questions. There are 3 sections in the test:

Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC)
Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning (DI & LR)
Quantitative Ability (QA)
The Quantitative Ability and Verbal & Reading Comprehension sections consisted 34 questions each, whereas the Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning section had 32 questions. This distribution of questions was same for CAT 2015 and CAT 2016. Before this, the distribution of questions was different. In CAT 2017, it is expected that a number of questions in each section may vary as compared to the previous year.

For CAT 2017, IIM Lucknow has released some points related to CAT Exam Pattern such as-

A few questions in each section of CAT may be of non-MCQs type questions (TITA- Type In The Answer).
Exactly 60 minutes will be allotted for answering each section.
Each question carries 3 marks and there is negative marking of 1 mark for each wrong answer.
No negative marking for non-MCQ type questions.
A virtual calculator (on-screen calculator) will be available throughout for the purpose of calculation.
The test takers cannot switch between the sections and have to attend the test in a particular order. The order of the sections is same for all the applicants-

VARC
DI & LR, and
QA
Four scaled scores will be presented for each candidate: an overall scaled score and three separate scaled scores for each section. As the three sections evaluate distinct sets of knowledge and skills, scores do not correlate across sections. A high score in one section does not guarantee a high score in another section. Percentile rankings are provided for each individual section as well as for the overall exam score.","CAT MBA Entrance Test Prep PRO<br><br>Key Features of this APP: <br>•	At practice mode you can see the explanation describing the correct answer.<br>•	Real exam style full mock exam with timed interface<br>•	Ability to create own quick mock by choosing the number of MCQ’s.<br>•	You can create your profile and see your result history with just one click.<br>•	This app contains large number of question set that covers all syllabus area.<br><br>Before 2009, CAT was a paper based test conducted on a single day for all candidates.

CAT is a computer-based test which consists of 100 objective type questions. There are 3 sections in the test:<br><br>Verbal and Reading Comprehension (VARC)<br>Data Interpretation &amp; Logical Reasoning (DI &amp; LR)<br>Quantitative Ability (QA)<br>The Quantitative Ability and Verbal &amp; Reading Comprehension sections consisted 34 questions each, whereas the Data Interpretation &amp; Logical Reasoning section had 32 questions. This distribution of questions was same for CAT 2015 and CAT 2016. Before this, the distribution of questions was different. In CAT 2017, it is expected that a number of questions in each section may vary as compared to the previous year.<br><br>For CAT 2017, IIM Lucknow has released some points related to CAT Exam Pattern such as-<br><br>A few questions in each section of CAT may be of non-MCQs type questions (TITA- Type In The Answer).<br>Exactly 60 minutes will be allotted for answering each section.<br>Each question carries 3 marks and there is negative marking of 1 mark for each wrong answer.<br>No negative marking for non-MCQ type questions.<br>A virtual calculator (on-screen calculator) will be available throughout for the purpose of calculation.<br>The test takers cannot switch between the sections and have to attend the test in a particular order. The order of the sections is same for all the applicants-<br><br>VARC<br>DI &amp; LR, and<br>QA<br>Four scaled scores will be presented for each candidate: an overall scaled score and three separate scaled scores for each section. As the three sections evaluate distinct sets of knowledge and skills, scores do not correlate across sections. A high score in one section does not guarantee a high score in another section.

249,Leadership and Management,"What's the difference between leadership and management?

The main difference between leaders and managers is that leaders have people follow them while managers have people who work for them. A successful business owner needs to be both a strong leader and manager to get their team on board to follow them towards their vision of success.

""Management is a set of processes that keep an organisation functioning. They make it work today – they make it hit this quarter's numbers. The processes are about planning, budgeting, staffing, clarifying jobs, measuring performance, and problem-solving when results did not go to plan.""

Leadership is very different. ""It is about aligning people to the vision, that means buy-in and communication, motivation and inspiration.""
